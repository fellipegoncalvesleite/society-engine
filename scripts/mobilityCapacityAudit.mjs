// EXPEDITIONARY-3 — dynamic mobility audit.
//
// Proves the four mobility concepts are genuinely SEPARATE and that a descriptive
// average never becomes a movement rule:
//   19.1 average is not a minimum/maximum and does not gate the next day
//   19.2 calendar-day mean != active-day mean when rest days exist
//   19.3 different histories -> bounded, reversible conditioning difference
//   19.4 need raises attempted output but never erases physical limits
//   19.5 rest restores fatigue faster than it changes conditioning
//   19.6 malnutrition lowers capacity via EXISTING nutrition state (no duplicate system)
//   19.9 loaded return is slower than unloaded
//   19.14 bounded state
//   19.15 determinism
