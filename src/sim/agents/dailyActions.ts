/**
 * TIME-1C — common daily-action aggregation interface.
 *
 * The maintenance trap this avoids: writing movement/trip logic four separate
 * times for daily / weekly / monthly / seasonal step modes. Instead, a daily
 * feature declares ONCE:
 *   - `firesOnDayOfSeason(dayOfSeason)` — a deterministic schedule predicate, and
 *   - `apply(world, day)` — a pure reducer for one fired day.
 *
 * The time system (`runDailyActions`, called from `advanceWorldByDays`) then runs
 * every registered action IDENTICALLY under all step modes by iterating only the
 * days that fall in the advanced span. Weekly/monthly/seasonal are therefore
 * accelerated approximations of the SAME daily logic — they never recompute a
 * naive 90-day loop, and they never diverge from the daily schedule.
 *
 * Hard contract for any registered action (so this stays safe):
 *   - PURE & deterministic: no `unseeded random call`, no `any`, no UI/render/Zustand.
 *   - It must NOT move the residential/home-range marker (`band.position`).
 *     Residential relocation stays in the seasonal `bandDecision` path. Mixing
 *     daily marker motion in here is exactly the SPIKE-MOBILITY-1 HEAT collapse.
 *   - Season-gated physical systems (demography, physical fission, depletion, resource economics)
 *     are deliberately NOT registered here; they run once per crossed season. Parent-side fission
 *     planning and deadline actions are the narrow exception: their kernel contracts are stated in
 *     DAYS, they move no bodies, and ordinary physical departure remains unregistered.

/**
 * Advance the registered daily actions across an in-season span of calendar days
 * `(startDay, startDay + elapsedDays]`. The caller (`advanceWorldByDays`) only
 * passes spans that do NOT cross a season boundary, so no season-gated pipeline
 * runs here.
 *
 * Iterates day-outer / action-inner: on each scheduled day, every action that
 * fires runs in fixed registry order — a deterministic "a day happens, then all
 * daily things that happen that day happen" model. With the schedule predicate,
 * an action that fires on 5 days/season costs 5 reducer calls regardless of the
 * step mode used to reach the boundary.
