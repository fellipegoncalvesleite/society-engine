// Cause-gated sub-tick migration walk (experimental spike, 2026-06-15).
//
// PURPOSE. A band that has ALREADY made a fully-scored seasonal migration decision
// (a residential `move_to_tile`/`explore` under a migration-class mobility intent)
// realizes that decision as a BREADCRUMB PATH of single-tile steps in its own chosen
// direction, instead of a single ≤2-tile hop. This corrects a real scale gap: the
// marker is a seasonal residential base, and a mobile forager's base displaces
// ~5–25 km/season — far more than the ≤3 km the single-hop cap allowed.
//
// THIS IS A PATH REALIZER, NOT A SECOND DECISION SYSTEM. It does not re-run the
// canonical band scorer (that would be risky duplication AND multiply the
// PERF-1-critical tick cost). It greedily extends the band's already-caused realized
// motion, tile by tile, using ONLY the band's own observed records (anti-omniscient),
// and stops when terrain/knowledge/crowding say so. Each step is grid-distance 1, so
// nothing ever teleports across a wall of mountains or a sea.
//
// PURITY: deterministic, no unseeded random call, no `any`, no WorldState/UI imports. The world
// is injected as a small `MigrationWalkView` so the walk is unit-testable in isolation.
// Seeded near-tie reordering is VAR-1-compliant (jitter ≪ score gaps; runSeed===undefined
// → zero jitter → legacy-identical ordering).
