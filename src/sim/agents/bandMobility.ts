// EXPEDITIONARY-3 — dynamic human mobility capacity, conditioning, and walking history.
//
// ARCHITECTURE (§6 Option B — mobility-role cohorts, NOT sex demography).
// Canonical population state has NO sex composition (BandDemography carries only
// dependents / workingAdults / elders), so this module deliberately makes **no
// male/female claim** and exposes no sex-specific average. Fabricating
// `adultMen = adults / 2` is exactly what the amendment forbids, and inventing
// conserved sex composition means sex-aware aging/mortality/birth/fission surgery on
// the single-net-rate demographic core — its own checkpoint. Sex hooks are future work.
//
// THE FOUR CONCEPTS ARE KEPT SEPARATE (§4) — never one `walkingDistance` field:
//   1. capacity      — DERIVED per party, never stored, so it can never go stale or
//                      become a second authority. Composition + nutrition + conditioning
//                      − fatigue.
//   2. conditioning  — STORED. Slow, bounded, diminishing, REVERSIBLE. Bodies accustomed
//                      to repeated work. Distinct from learned technique, which lives in
//                      the adaptation subsystem behind its public boundary.
//   3. fatigue       — NOT stored here. Read from the EXISTING
//                      `band.pressureState.fatiguePressure`; §19.6 forbids duplicating a
//                      health system.
//   4. history       — STORED, bounded. Written ONLY from completed physical movement.
//                      Kilometres are physical telemetry independent of grid resolution.
//
// The hard rule the amendment repeats: history CONDITIONS gradually, it never PERMITS.
// There is no `allowedDistance = historicalAverage` anywhere in this file. Today's
// realized distance is decided by today's capacity and today's need; yesterday's walking
// only nudges conditioning, and only after recovery.
