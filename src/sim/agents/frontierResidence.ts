// FrontierResidence v0 (checkpoint M0.4) — Emergent, band-known frontier RETENTION.
//
// WHY THIS EXISTS (M0.3 limitation `improved_reach_without_retention`): with
// FrontierIntent v0 daughters now REACH the frontier (max lineage distance 10→19),
// but they do not HOLD it — `daughtersMaintainNewRange25Years = 0`,
// `frontierPersistenceScore = 0`. The M0.4 return-pull audit showed this is an
// OSCILLATION problem, not an absence of reach: the best daughter already spends
// 15.25 CONSECUTIVE years (and 20+ cumulative) outside the origin radius, but keeps
// stepping back across it toward a marginally-better-KNOWN interior locus (strong
// reformed place attachment ≈0.8–0.96 + band-known inner opportunities at
// per-capita ≈1.0), which breaks the streak before a 25-year range can form.
//
// WHAT THIS DOES: lets a frontier daughter EARN a bounded, decaying retention value
// at the locus she actually dwells in, from her OWN local experience — repeated
// presence, decent local return trend, water/refuge confirmation, band-known
// opportunity nearby, corridor memory, and her own formed place attachment. Once
// that value is established it is used as a narrow tie-breaker to (a) hold the
// frontier locus and (b) damp the inward (toward-origin) backtrack — so fragmented
// frontier presence consolidates into a held new range and natural attachment/
// confidence take over.
//
// HARD SCOPE LOCK (M0.4): no omniscient richness (reads only band-known/scouted/
// inherited fields — never hidden tile truth), no forced daughters (value only
// COMPETES with the remembered origin, never erases it; a poor frontier yields low
// value and is still abandoned), no global attachment weakening, no camps/
// settlements, no yield/stress/mortality/carrying-capacity/plant change, no
// unseeded random call, no `any`, no UI/render/React/Zustand imports. Daughters only — a
// band with no parent (a founder/parent at its origin refuge) never establishes
// residence, so parents keep their refuge. Fully reversible: when she leaves the
// locus or local evidence fades the value decays to `undefined`, leaving no trace.
