// VALUE OF INFORMATION of going to look: how much uncertainty a closer look could
// resolve, weighted by the band's own need and season, minus distance / route / repeat
// costs. A high score means "worth scouting", NOT "worth moving". The scout, when
// applied, observes the target (band perception, residence-unchanged) and lets the
// existing observation->resource-knowledge pipeline raise mostly presence/access/season
// confidence. It never updates yield, carrying capacity, stress, mortality, or the
// residential position, and it never assumes the band understands edibility / processing
// / safety (knowing a patch exists is not knowing how to exploit it).

// Scout target search is already technically bounded by the band's capped patch-memory list.
// There is no universal cell-count or kilometre reach gate here: physical feasibility is
// decided by the route + round-trip timing executor before any observation can be written.
