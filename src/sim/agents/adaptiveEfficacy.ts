// ADAPTIVE EFFICACY FEEDBACK-1 — response-specific practice efficacy.
//
// PROBLEM THIS SOLVES: `classifyAttemptOutcome` previously judged every
// adaptive attempt by the band's broad movement outcome (moved + general
// collapse pressure fell ⇒ success), so a practical response could earn
// confidence from movement that had nothing to do with it. The correct chain
// is: experienced condition → practical response attempted → response affects
// a REAL coefficient/outcome → the sim measures whether THAT response helped
// in THAT context → local confidence changes → later matching behavior changes.
//
// LOOP 1 — crossing practice (route_crossing family). The real coefficient is
// `riverCrossingRisk`: practiced-crossing relief (crossingPractice.ts, cap
// 0.35, per-ford, perishable) is paid by the decision at a specific crossing
// key. Efficacy here reads the DECISION-TIME context (which crossing was
// scored, how much relief was actually applied, raw vs effective risk,
// whether the crossing was blocked) plus the REALIZED outcome (which crossing
// the residential move actually recorded into KnownCrossingMemory, and how
// remembered danger moved). Movement without a matching crossing earns the
// response NOTHING.
//
// LOOP 2 — camp shift (camp_care family). The real signal is the band's OWN
// local use-pressure (camp wear/fouling proxy — the same `usePressure` record
// campMovement's relief scoring pays). A LOCAL one-tile shift made without a
// seasonal travel motive is credited only when the residence wear signal it
// addressed measurably fell; staying put or travelling far for other motives
// earns the camp response nothing.
//
// PRIORITY (never inverted): specific failure/danger > specific clear success
// > specific partial success > specific low/no feedback > generic fallback
// (returning `undefined` hands classification back to the generic movement
// rules, which remain for families without real efficacy signals).
//
// PROPERTIES: pure, deterministic, bounded, anti-omniscient (reads only the
// band's own memories and the coefficients its decision actually paid), local
// (per crossing key / per camp tile — never a universal skill), and fragile
// (failure and danger evidence is first-priority; staleness is inherited from
// crossingPractice decay). No unseeded randomness, no `any`, no UI imports.
