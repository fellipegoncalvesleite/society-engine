// ENVIRONMENT-READING PRACTICAL ADAPTATION / INVENTION-1 — practical responses.
//
// A PRACTICAL RESPONSE is a composed, context-bound way of acting that a band
// may develop because of conditions it repeatedly experiences. The causal
// chain is strict:
//
//   repeated experienced condition (real pressure/burden evidence)
//   → learned fragments (practicalFragments.ts — material/technique/route)
//   → a response VARIANT composed from specific fragments
//   → a capped effect on a REAL coefficient (seasonal travel budget limiters,
//     migration hardship) in MATCHING context only
//   → response-specific efficacy (adaptiveEfficacy.ts evaluators)
//   → confidence, partial success, failure, revision, dormancy, abandonment
//   → changed future behavior.
//
// Responses are NOT inventory, technology unlocks, crafting recipes, or
// identity labels. A variant name ("fiber sling") explains a configuration of
// fragments; learned fragments justify the idea, while a material artifact may
// affect physics only when a separate execution authority proves it was actually
// made/used. Two bands can reach the same label through different histories, or
// never form one at all.
//
// IMPLEMENTED response families:
//   * carrying_load  — condition: sustained carrying/care burden on residential
//     travel; effect: bounded relief on the travel plan's carry-constraint and
//     vulnerable-share limiters + a capped reduction of the dependent/elder
//     hardship terms of a residential move.
//   * dry_route_water — condition: repeated water stress with movement
//     pressure; effect: bounded relief on the travel plan's water-stress
//     limiter, ONLY when the scored destination is one of the band's own
//     remembered watered places (staging between known water points).
//   * engineering_structure — problem/fragments/ideas/responses/experiment plans
//     may still form; its variants are material_execution_required, so without
//     a separate physical execution authority they grant zero crossing-safety
//     relief and zero material efficacy maturation. Pass 2 intentionally does
//     not create that material execution authority.
//
// DECLARED-ONLY response families (registry below documents what real substrate
// each still needs): hunting_distance, temporary_shelter, water_storage and
// animal_proximity. Proto-animal management is implemented separately in
// animalLearning.ts; the generic response family remains deliberately inert.
//
// Purity: deterministic, bounded, no unseeded randomness, no `any`, no UI
// imports, anti-omniscient (band-known evidence only).
