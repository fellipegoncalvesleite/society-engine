// bounded per-tile "claim" index: each active band projects a bounded foraging
// footprint (its persisted anchor catchment, or a small ring-walk over its OWN
// known tiles), weighted by its foraging draw and distance decay. A tile's support
// is then divided among its claimants in proportion to their claim weight.
//

// it simply experiences a smaller share of a contested patch (real exploitation
// competition), exactly as overlapping foragers would. Bounded: each footprint is
// capped, and the index is memoized on the cache (built at most once per cache).

// CORRECTION-34A §9 — LOCAL EXTRACTION EFFORT. Read the history before changing this.
//
// This quantity divides a CONTESTED PHYSICAL CATCHMENT between bands: it decides how much of a
// tile's support each competing band draws. It is therefore an extraction-effort term, and the
// previous comment here said something different — it said the value "Matches the adult-equivalent
// demand formula in carryingCapacity.derivePopulationDemand so the shared division and the demand
// denominator are on the same scale." Naming a quantity extraction effort while calibrating it to
// consumption demand is the §9 conflation, and it had a physical consequence: `demo.workingAdults`
// is the FULL count, so a band with three of nine adults away kept claiming the residential
// catchment as though all nine were foraging locally, while those same three were provisioned from
// the party's own carried budget and were removing stock at a DIFFERENT tile through
// `resolveExpeditionTargetWork`. One worker, two extractions.
//
// The repair is Option C — separate effort from demand — applied to the AUTHORITY only:
//   * effort (here) counts the adults PHYSICALLY AT CAMP, so an away worker extracts in exactly
//     one place, the place where their body is;
//   * demand (carryingCapacity.derivePopulationDemand) is deliberately UNTOUCHED and still counts
//     the whole band, because an away worker still has to be fed.
//
// The dependent/elder weights are deliberately NOT retuned. They are the existing calibration, and
// §9 forbids preserving aggregate output by adjusting unrelated terms — so this changes WHO is
// counted, never how strongly each person counts. Committed adults come from the same authority
// `deriveAvailableMobilityPools` uses, so "who is at camp" cannot diverge between the two readers.

  // them (`adults -= adultsAged; elders += adultsAged;`) without moving anybody.
  //
  // Subtracting the away headcount from adults alone would then leave that person counted in
  // `elders`, contributing 0.85 of LOCAL extraction effort from an expedition tile. The overflow —
  // away people the working-adult cohort can no longer account for — is therefore taken out of
